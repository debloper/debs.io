    <h1>Hello there!</h1>
    <p>I'm a soul of child in his dad's body, with his grandpa's brains. I have a big mouth, bigger thumbs, and an even bigger neocortex (rather, the neocortex has me - it's a sweetoxic relationship). I am pretty good at moderating the relentless group discussions raging on inside my head; and gradually getting better at pretending to be a decent, approachable human being.</p>
    <p>I'm not good at small-talk, but I do enjoy in-depth topical discussions across various domains. I yarn for people who can shut me up, and places where I'm not the smartest one in it. If you're still not sufficiently weirded out, there's a chance we can be friends.</p>
    <p>Thanks for stopping by... and if you're here just for 'business', then <a href="https://cv.debs.io">here's my resume</a>.</p>
